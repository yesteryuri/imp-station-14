  # Section C: Metashield

  This page will discuss a list of various information or items protected by our rules. Something that is "shielded" cannot be known by your character during a round until ANY of the "breaking" conditions happen. This also means your character cannot act upon shielded information. Doing so before the shield is broken is referred to as metagaming.

  Anytime a shield is broken, it applies for the remainder of the round, in all other instances, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

  ## Always Shielded:
  - Current gamemode, and any antagonists that could exist as a result.
  - Events experienced as a different character.
  - Any and all information related to the player of a character, or certain strategies a player may use as an antagonist.
  - Any information revealed while your character is in critical condition, asleep, dead, or a ghost.
  - Any information your character knew before death, if you become a ghost role mid-round.
  - The exact cause of your death. For the purposes of this shield, if you enter critical condition but are resuscitated before dying, you can remember what caused you to fall unconscious.
  - Events from prior rounds. NOTE: Events can be discussed, but they should not hold any bearing on the current round.

  ## Sometimes Shielded:
