You can have bad highs when this happens if the duckling awakens the serpent and it bites the duckling. The interesting part is when you ingest alcohol after THC because it floods the vessel and causes the serpent to fall into a deep sleep. The duckling never gets attacked by the serpent when this happens because it is unconscious and the duckling is actually able to get fat from the harmonious seed, which causes an enjoyable sensation.

    The fallen leaves tell a story.

    The great Elden Ring was shattered.

    In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.

    Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,

    and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish.

    Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.

    The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.

    A war from which no lord arose.

    A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.

    Arise now, ye Tarnished.

    Ye dead, who yet live.

    The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.

    Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands.

    The ever-brilliant Goldmask.

    Fia, the Deathbed Companion.

    The loathsome Dung Eater.

    And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.

    And one other. Whom grace would again bless.

    A Tarnished of no renown.

    Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.

    To stand before the Elden Ring.

    And become the Elden Lord.

I'm there to: 1) survive the fuckin' round. 2) Guard the armory. So you can absolutely get fucked. If I get unbanned, which I won't, you can guarantee I will continue to use the shotgun to apprehend criminals because it's quick, clean, and effective as fuck. Why in the seven hells would I fuck around with the disabler shots--which takes half the clip just to bring someone down--or with the taser bolts, which are slow as balls, impossible to aim, and do about next to jack shit.

    I am a professional Cottage Cheese Consumer! While I was at Aldi‚Äôs today I picked up some Cottage Cheese! It was Aldi‚Äôs Friendly Farm! I have never tried this brand. I grew up eating another brand. One of my favorite way to eat Cottage Cheese is with chunky salsa

    I came home and eagerly, excitedly opened the container and when I put the fork to my mouth I couldn‚Äôt help but smile! I am a professional Cottage Cheese Consumer and I know how Cottage Cheese should be. The way it should smells as I bring it closer to my lips. I know the way it should feel when it touches my tongue. And I know the way it should taste! Cottage Cheese should be Cold, Soothing, Comforting, Salty, Soft, Creamy. It surpassed my expectations!!! Friendly Farm Cottage Cheese was Cold, Soothing, Comforting, Salty, Soft, and Creamy! Not like another brand has not been. I have been so disappointed with other. When you buy small curd you expect small curd. Every other carton of small curd that I have purchased from other brands ends up having clunky large curds in it. It is very disappointing. They are gross. I am a professional Cottage Cheese Consumer and I will only get Aldi‚Äôs Cottage Cheese from now on. ‚Äî Ôøºfeeling blessed.

    Your misery is poison from within, autotoxemia ‚Äî it will take *your own body* to do something about *your own body*. Without any means of melting the glacier you must instead invent your way out. Etch a foothold on the sheer icy cliff face that is the daily despair you have begotten.

login-tips-dataset-775 = I needed this place, to listen to the words people have to say. That's something they could never understand. You've done your part. You told us plenty. You've known the pain of ages. And even now you think, as any person would, that this can't be happening. Is it education? Morals, faith? Just an imprint of a lifetime of stories? Face to face with oblivion, which is where you are, and you still think that help is coming. The world you were born into is made to save you. Isn't that right? Of course it is. Everyone knows that. Until your last breath, you know it. Without the slightest chance or reason left to them, humans are capable of hope. I'm no different. But for one thing. When my time came calling I didn't die. My family died, my country died, but they didn't take me with them. All Hell took from me was this skin, this outer peel that marked me "human." My village had an oilseed field and a fine factory. Every day my friends and I would see our parents at work in that factory. That's all I had. All the world I knew. Then one day, aircraft came droning in from some far-off sky. The factory was bombed. Some... "spies" had told them we were making weapons. The building burned. We tried to flee outside. The crowd blocked the exit. The crowd of people. Hot. So hot. I tried to push through their legs and get ahead, but a boot in my stomach put me on the ground. The smoke of them burning filled me up. I heard my name called... but not for long. At the infirmary they carried me to, a nurse in the corner saw me and remarked, as if it happened every day: "They should let the poor thing die." Those are the only words of my mother tongue I remember. It was the language of my village. Until foreign troops invaded. Then the last identity I had left - the words I spoke - were pulled from me. My skin would never feel anything again. This face would be burned again, in torture, at foreign hands, but I, I still writhe in that burning factory. Doused in scalding rapeseed oil. That's all I have to feel, that pain - all I have to remind me I exist here. Those "spies" reported well. We made weapons all right. As cartloads of rifles came in from the battlefields, we fixed them up and sent them back out. So our country could win. Or rather, so that little world we knew could continue. I came to realize I mustn't die. I'm their last hope, all those who perished and left me here. I have to accomplish something. If I don't, their will will be swept out of this world. So? Do you see me now? Tell me. What do you see? Hmm? You have eyes. What do your eyes see? Yes, that's right. You see a skull face. You see me. This skull is who I am. My mark, my proof of humanity. I have no country, no language, I have no face, but I haven't lost my skull. So I told myself... The pain and effort that keep me alive will never know relief, never bear fruit, never be repaid. I know that, but I told myself to focus on some hope, a nonexistent hope to guide me through this burning world. A hope - call it a dream. A melancholic delusion. As the pressures within me stretch me to bursting, and I force myself not to cry out, though the words I thought were carved into me are gone, and all I knew is dead. I know how you feel. I've felt that. So show me. That I'm not the only one. That you too can return to this world, for revenge. Do you see me? Don't die. Don't die! Ahh‚Ä¶

    "Unfortunate" doesn't begin to describe my series, this game rewards blind luck and nothing else, I am beyond convinced at this point. After getting completely tooled by scheduling with my opponent changing times on me last minute and refusing to provide confirmation prior to the day of the match as to play times, losing this way somehow felt even worse than I had thought possible. My preparation was superior, my play was superior, and I lost, so I don't see a reason to continue engaging in an activity where what is within my control is overwhelmingly outweighed by what is not.



    I am done with competitive Pokemon, and you won't get a fond farewell. This community is infected to its roots with a degenerative disease that grows stronger over time but stops short of killing its host. Tournaments used to have a competitive spirit at their heart, this has been transplanted and replaced with an artificial organ that feeds on vitriol and mockery from insecure little boys that heckle by the sidelines and tear each other to shreds over scraps of attention. The environment we fostered has trapped us all like this in a vicious cycle, and escaping it requires acceptance of the harshest reality we all scramble to explain away, that none of the countless straining efforts we put ourselves through here will ever amount to one single shining glimmer of significance. I would make this the end, but World Cup is still ongoing, and I would never leave so many great friends out to dry, so I'll suffer through a few more games for them.



    One last thing before I leave you all to react with disdain, ridicule, and self-righteous fervor, before you do everything in your power to minimize my words and thoughts, box them up and shove them to some cobwebbed corner of your memory, and hope they disappear forever as a stain on your finite time ground to dust. From this moment on, nothing you say matters to me. The foulest insults you hurl with intent to wound will calmly settle at the earth before my feet, and the venom you spit will bring all the pain of a warm summer breeze. You are less than anything you can conceive, while I carry on, brimming with joy distilled from detachment.
login-tips-dataset-777 = I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.

login-tips-dataset-843 = I am going to have sex with this female Flame Atronach from Oblivion. I find the Flame Atronaches in The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion sexy. However, their body is made up of 87% fire, and 100% fire surrounds them. That could kill me if I tried to have sex with one. To remedy this, the Flame Atronach casts a spell on me making me resistant to fire. Keep in mind, resistant is not the same as immune. I still take damage. It is either 1 point or 0 points of damage each second I am having sex with her. Just because a particular second caused 0 points of damage, does not mean that I did not feel anything, it just means I took no damage. I am not going to rush through having sex with this Flame Atronach. I make sure I pleasure anything I have sex with-especially non-humans! I'd rather take damage than not pleasure the Flame Atronach. The Flame Atronach and I go to the Planes of Oblivion to have sex. When having sex with non-humans, it is ALWAYS sexier to have sex in their natural habitat rather than a human's natural habitat. The Planes of Oblivion is the Flame Atronach's natural habitat.
