traitor-mi13-goal =  You are an intelligence officer with MI13, deployed by the Coalition of Planets to keep tabs on Nanotrasen... and the Syndicate, too. It's in your best interests to play both sides against each other as much as you can while keeping out of the fight yourself.

traitor-mi13-allies = As a government employee, you don't have that many allies to watch your back. You can at least trust Boeing, Radio TV Solutions, and the Tony Blair Institiute, though.

Anybody willing to do our dirty work is a good ally in our book. Our ex-colleagues in the WAFFLE ZAIBATSU are not to be tolerated. Eliminate them if it won't jeopardize the mission. The traitors to the cause Donk Co., and those insane Dahir Insaat tinkerers are not to be trusted.
traitor-waffleco-uplink = While opening your Syrups of the Month box, you spy a small, Cybersun-branded chip floating in one of the bottles. Inserting it into your PDA installed the uplink and provided your orders. The syrup has hardened and it won't come out...

traitor-blackpyre-allies = Death comes for us all, but it's best delivered with tact. Cunning operatives, such as CyberSun's specialists, may be helpful to you. Do not ally with destruction hungry fools like the dogs of Gorlex- who create far more bodies than are necessary. There are only so many graves!
traitor-blackpyre-uplink = Provided via many tightly written legal arrangements with CyberSun, you found your uplink at a loved one's grave. The message was clear- For someone out there, the bell tolls.

Report to listening post operatives for relay when available. God save the Kaiser.
traitor-brandenburg-allies = Corporate warmongering interests like Boeing, Vainger Biotics, and the Gorlex Marauders tend to be especially close allies of ours. But remember; revealing your affiliation with intelligence collection carries an inherent risk of betrayal. Be careful who you trust. Additionally, avoid anyone with affiliation to governmental bodies. Nanotrasen aren't the only people we collect intelligence on, and giving our enemies an alert that we're spying in the sector could ruin all of our operations. Especially avoid the Decapoid Empire, the Dominus Empire of Camelot IV, and MI13.
