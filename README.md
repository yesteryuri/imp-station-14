Impstation is a fork of Space Station 14, a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.

While we are not a server that allows sexual content, <b>we do not allow people under the age of 20 to play on Impstation.</b>

## Documentation/Wiki

SS14's [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.com/) has documentation on SS14's content, engine, game design, and more.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody. Get in Discord if you want to help. We've got a [list of issues](https://github.com/impstation/imp-station-14/issues) that need to be done and anybody can pick them up. Don't be afraid to ask for help either!

As a baseline make sure your changes and pull requests are in accordance with the upstream [contribution guidelines](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/codebase-info/pull-request-guidelines.html). We're generally not as strict, but it's good practice to follow these examples.

If you are adding completely custom content that would go into the normal SS14 file structure in a certain spot, add that content to the `_Impstation` folder with that same file path instead. For example, when adding the GBsay chat command for ghost bar stuff, it would have gone in `Content.Server/Chat/Commands`. Instead, the `GBsay.cs` file is in `Content.Server/_Impstation/Chat/Commands`.

The Impstation folders are located at `Content.Client/_Impstation`, `Content.Server/_Impstation`, and `Content.Shared/_Impstation`. The Resources folder is kind of its own beast, and has a lot of depth. For that reason it makes sense to have the _Impstation folder inside of the subfolder it is modifying. As another example, the main prototypes folder for our  custom content is located in `Resources/Prototypes/_Impstation`. The custom Spy vs Spy gamemode is defined in `Resources/Prototypes/_Impstation/GameRules/roundstart.yml`. This applies for recipies, clothing, everything.

Keeping things defined like this makes the lives of the people maintaining the server much, much easier.

We are not currently accepting translations of the game on our main repository. If you would like to translate the game into another language, consider creating a fork or contributing to a fork.
